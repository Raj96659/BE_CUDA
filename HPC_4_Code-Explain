It includes necessary header files such as <iostream> for input/output, and <cstdlib> for rand() function.
The add function is a CUDA kernel that performs vector addition. It takes three integer arrays A, B, and C along with the size of the vectors as input parameters. Each thread computes the addition of corresponding elements from vectors A and B and stores the result in vector C.
The print function prints the elements of an integer array.
In the main function:
It prompts the user to enter the size of the vectors (N).
Allocates memory for host arrays A, B, and C.
Reads elements of vectors A and B from the user.
Allocates memory for device arrays X, Y, and Z.
Copies data from host to device.
Calculates the number of blocks and threads per block needed for kernel invocation.
Invokes the add kernel.
Copies the result back from device to host.
Prints the result.
Frees allocated device and host memory.
